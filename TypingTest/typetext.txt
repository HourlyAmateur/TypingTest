The Riegelmann Boardwalk (also known as the Coney Island Boardwalk)
is a 2.7-mile-long (4.3 km) boardwalk along the southern shore
of the Coney Island peninsula in the New York City borough of
Brooklyn, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. Opened in 1923, it has
become an icon of Coney Island, with appearances in the visual
arts, music, and film. The boardwalk has been considered the most
important public works project in Brooklyn since the Brooklyn
Bridge, with an impact comparable to Central Park. By the mid-19th
century, the Coney Island waterfront was divided by owners who
erected barriers. First discussed in the late 1890s as a means
of uniting the different sections of Coney Island, the boardwalk
was designed by Philip P. Farley, and named for Brooklyn borough
president Edward J. Riegelmann, who championed its construction.
Its first portion opened in 1923, and it connects sites such as
the New York Aquarium, Luna Park and MCU Park. (Full article...)
